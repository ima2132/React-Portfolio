## Description
For this challenge, I was once again tasked with creating a portfolio. There are several motives behind this assignment. The primary goal of this project is to create a distinctive portfolio that highlights your proficiency in `React` and showcases your deployed projects. This significantly distinguishes you from other developers who may not be using the latest technologies for their portfolios. 

The design for this portfolio was inspired by Windows '98, which also happens to be my birth year. This is my way of incorporating my essence into this portfolio.
