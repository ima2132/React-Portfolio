## Description
For this challenge, I was once again tasked with creating a portfolio. There are several motives behind this assignment. The primary goal of this project is to create a distinctive portfolio that highlights your proficiency in `React` and showcases your deployed projects. This significantly distinguishes you from other developers who may not be using the latest technologies for their portfolios. 

## Installation

Run the following command in your terminal:

`npm install`

This command will install all the necessary dependencies for running the application.
