## Description
For this challenge, I was once again tasked with creating a portfolio. There are several motives behind this assignment. The primary goal of this project is to create a distinctive portfolio that highlights your proficiency in `React` and showcases your deployed projects. This significantly distinguishes you from other developers who may not be using the latest technologies for their portfolios. 

## Installation 
To access this project on your local machine, start by cloning the repository. You will then need to install dependencies in order to use the application.

Run the following command in your terminal:

`npm install`

This command will install all the necessary dependencies for running the application.

To initiate the application locally, use the following command:

`npm start`

## Usage
The main objective of this project is to demonstrate your proficiency in `React`. This portfolio essentially functions as a digital resume, allowing you to showcase deployed projects and technical skills.
